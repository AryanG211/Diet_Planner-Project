NOTE:

The model is trained using two algorithms: Random Forest and K-Means.

Data transformation has been performed to prepare the dataset as required.

Due to data transformation, there is a possibility of incorrect food category labeling in the dataset, which could lead to an incorrect diet plan.

The dataset is provided in this repo.
